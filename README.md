# CS-AURO

Repo for my Automated Robotics Course. Includes all practicals.

# What is AURO?

AURO stands for Autonomous Robotics. It is a course taken at the University of York.

##  Module aims
This module will introduce students to the theoretical concepts and practical skills required to engineer autonomous robotic systems. It will cover fundamental aspects of sensors/actuators and control systems, then build upon this foundation with high-level algorithms for autonomous localisation, mapping, navigation, and multi-robot coordination. This module will also explore safety considerations and ethical implications of the design, implementation, and deployment of autonomous robotic systems.

## Module learning outcomes
- Describe the degrees of autonomy that robotic systems can achieve

- Discuss the safety considerations and ethical implications of the design, implementation, and deployment of autonomous robotic systems

- Explain methodological principles for engineering autonomous robotic systems

- Demonstrate an understanding of modern robotics middleware and its application

- Implement an autonomous robotic solution for a predefined problem

- Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of an implemented autonomous robotic solution
