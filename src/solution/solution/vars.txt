issue:

in multi robot system, when 1 robot picks up an item it registers as if all of them are holding_item
make it so each robot has its own state, cuz when 1 picks up an item, they both go to returning state
also with obstacle avoidance, when 1 sees an obstacle, all the bots act as if there's an obstacle

make variables for linear and angular velocity as well

also how do I cancel the gotopose? so it stops going to home once the item is dropped off

Need to have obstacle avoidance even in fetching state
